# When The Factory
## Build & requirements
### Warning
For now the build has only been tested on Linux. It might work on other OS such as Windows but it is not guranted.

### Requirements
For now the requierments to build the project are:
- `gcc`
- `make`
- `cmake`
- `sdl2`
- `sdl2_image`
- `sdl2_ttf`

### Build process
For now there are two options that are equivalent.<br>
- You can either build the project by running the script `cmakebuild.sh`
Note: You can after run the executable by running `./wtf` while being in the `bin/` directory. 
Or you can also run the build script by passing the `-r` option to it.

- Or if you're familliar with VSCode, you can directly build and/or run the project via the usual commands.
